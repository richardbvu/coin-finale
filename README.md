# How It's Made
Built with : 
* React
* CSS
* API



# Lessons Learned
I've learned countless lessons that I'm proud of. Here's some lessons that I'd like to share: 

* Delved into a range of cryptocurrency APIs currently on the market, such as those provided by CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap, and Binance. My choice was guided by factors like the clearness of the documentation, the capabilities of the API, limitations on request rates, and the level of support from the developer community.
* Utilized Axios for a GET request to retrieve API data, enabling the display of real-time information in a compelling and straightforward way.
